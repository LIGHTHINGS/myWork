Ansible 2024 Notes

There are two types of inventory:
1. Static  2. Dynamic

Dynamic inventory is preferred due to restart of host server
which can happen as cloud systems have dowmtimes.

For AWS:
To check the list of ansible inventory plugin with command:
 ansible-doc -t inventory -l

then: add plugins to ansible.cfg as default plugins

=> [inventory]
   enable_plugins = host_list, script, ini, auto, yaml, toml

then: sudo install boto3 and botocore specifically for AWS

=> pip3 install boto3 which usually has botocore

then: create an AWS IAM acces_key and secret_key

=> all is done on AWS web or console, then save
the access key as variable AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID &
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY

then: create an AWS yaml file for aws plugin
=> plugin: amazon.aws.aws_ec2
then run the command : ansible-inventory -i <AWS PLUGIN FILE NAME> --graph /list

to use the incentory dynamically :
=> ansible all  -i <plugin yaml file> -m ping
	
NOTE: WHEN CONNECTING, AWS WILL BOUNCE YOU BECAUSE
IT REFUSES YOU FROM BEING ROOT HENCE YOU'D MODIFY YOUR COMMAND :

=> ansible all -i <plugin yaml file> -u ec2-user -m ping

Also, there is need to add a command to the plugin yaml file
=> filters: 
	instance-state-name: running
^
|| this handles error if something wrong happened to the host




FOR GCP: 
	The YML file will look like
plugin : gcp_compute
Projects: 
	<gcp_project_id>
auth_kind: serviceaccount
service_account_file: <path>
#we can add filter to get certain host too, check image: GCP.YML.png
